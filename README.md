# Scheduling app

## This is a work in progress.
###### After a couple months of learning Python and Flask by following "The Flask Mega-Tutorial" by Miguel Grinberg, I am now working on my own Flask app. It will be a scheduling web app which I have designed based off the needs of the small business I work at, where I teach music. I have designed the db, front end, and back end.

Functionality will include:
- Maintaining multiple teacher's records and their complex schedules
- Managing account records and billing information
- Maintaining student attendance
- Scheduling students with recurring lesson times
- Ability to reschedule lessons
- Keeping records of student attendance
- Full search capability
